# TravelTide-KMeans-Customer-Segmentation
This repository holds a Jupyter Notebook detailing an intricate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and K-Means clustering for TravelTide, a fictional e-booking startup.

## Overview
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository is geared towards assisting TravelTide in refining its marketing strategy by leveraging K-Means clustering for optimal customer segmentation. The process unfolds from in-depth EDA, correlation matrix insights, and data preprocessing, to the heart of the analysis: K-Means clustering.
